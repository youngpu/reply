# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned how to use the library by mainly following the examples that were already given by the creator. That also made it a lot easier for me to write my own examples, as it gives me ideas and foundations. Then the next thing to do was 
to simply read the codes through carefully. But even then that wasn't very easy, which leads me to think that it'd be a lot easier if the codes were already fully commented and explained. But the part that made it easier was the logic flow 
in which the code was written, it was very logical thus made it easier to follow. The hardest part of the code was the be able to understand the parameters in each function, and in the long functions it gets difficult to follow and track 
everything. The main thing that would've made this code easier is if there were already original useful comments to begin with.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
>It means that by this point people should have learned on how to write proper and useful comments, not simply commenting for the sake of commenting, as it was often a mistake made by students in CSE 142, myself included. 
It is a lot easier to miss the big picture when commenting and simply comment the small and not important details. Therefore to explain to a CSE student, I would simply tell them that they are now explaining the code to someone 
that does not understand coding language but yet you have to explain to them each function. Therefore it would force them to skip talking about the small details and instead focus on the big pictures.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
Roughly 5 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
Just the professor for problems with the jsdoc.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
There were obviously multiple problems with the jsdoc and it did not work inititally for all the students. Therefore I think the professor and TAs should have have went over this first, and therefore mention
to students of bugs and problems that may show up, instead of having the students struggle to find an answer. I understand that the struggle in learning jsdoc can also be a part of the teaching tool, but it 
simply seems irrelevant and not really related to the current assignment.
